= Concurrent Programming course introduction


== Goals

In summary, provide the knowledge and skills required to design and implement applications over multi-threaded and asynchronous programming models, with emphasis on the concurrency and coordination aspects.

== Programme

* Introduction to multi-threaded models and concurrent programming.

* Design of custom synchronizers using monitors on the JVM platform.

* Memory models and lock-free algorithms and data structures.

* Asynchronous I/O and asynchronous programming models on the JVM platform and the Kotlin language.

See link:../calendar.adoc[calendar] for a more details programme, including *relevant dates* for this semester.

== Evaluation

See link:../evaluation.adoc[evaluation].
