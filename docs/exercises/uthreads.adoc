# Exercises about `uthreads`

To develop and run `uthreads` with Visual Studio Code in a container, use the following procedure:

* Make sure Docker Desktop is installed.
* Open Visual Studio Code in the `native` folder.
* Make sure the `Dev Containers` extension is installed.
* On the bottom left corner, click the icon and select `Open in container`.
* Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code and run
** `uname` - Should print `Linux`, meaning that it is a shell running on Linux and not on the host OS.
** `gcc --version` - Should print something like `gcc (Debian 12.2.0-14) 12.2.0`, meaning that the C development tools are available.
* To reopen Visual Studio Code on the host OS, use the bottom left corner and select `Reopen Folder Locally`.

## uthreads-0-minimal

* When does a call to `ut_run` returns?
.. Always before any other thread runs.
.. After `context_switch` is called once on each thread.
.. After the main thread calls `ut_yield`.
.. When there aren't anymore threads in the ready state. 

* What does `ut_init` does?
.. Allocate the stack for the main thread.
.. Creates the main thread.
.. Initializes the ready queue.
.. Does a context_switch.

* When is the memory for the thread descriptor de-allocated?
.. Never.
.. When `ut_free` is called.
.. When `context_switch_and_free` is called.
.. when `ut_run` returns.

* The location of each thread stack and descriptor is
.. Unrelated.
.. The descriptor is located at the top of the memory area reserved for the stack.
.. The descriptor is located at the bottom of the memory area reserved for the stack.
.. The descriptor is always located at the _top of the stack_.

* On the `context_switch_and_free`, why is the call to the `free` function done _after_ the instruction `movq (%rsi), %rsp`?

* Change the source code so that
** The `ut_create` function receives a thread name.
** Every `context_switch`` writes in the standard output the names of the two threads involved in that switch.
